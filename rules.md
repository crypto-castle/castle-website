# 1 Crytpo Castle

[Crypto Castle](https://cryptocastle.tech/) is a fully open-source DAO, governed and funded by the JMES Blockchain.

The Castle is (a candidate for) the Core-Engineering DAO slot in the JMES Protocol, which develops and maintains the Official JMES World Core Software, such as the Validator network and Official Mobile wallet app.

This DAO is a non-profit, non-commercial DAO, that raises its funding from the JMES blockchain's Governance System and redistributes [JMES](https://www.jmes.world/) issued from [block rewards](https://docs.jmes.money) to users who produce open-source output that forwards our [Strategy](#13-strategy) in support of our [Vision](#12-vision).

The DAO uses its own micro-incentive based [Bounty](#2-bounties) system to fund and manage the end-to-end delivery of a wide variety of projects [proposed](#21-concepts) by the community, ranging from small [jobs](#22-bounty-types) such as bug bounties, to ongoing [services](#22-bounty-types) such as promotions or infrastructure provision, to mid-size development [projects](#22-bounty-types) such as protocol and end-user software development.

Fund allocation and management is decentralized across [Admin](#4-admins) users who are [incentivized](#44-admin-rewards) with a percentage of the JMES they award on Bounties and a [PO role](#53-proposal-owner) responsible for fund management.

The DAO is classified as an [open-source DAO](#14-full-transparency), meaning that all  finances and internal operations of the DAO are conducted in the public domain at all times. This includes how work is proposed, selected, specified, developed, tested, approved, which users are completing or managing work, what rewards they are allocating or receiving and all internal decision making and governance.

All work produced by the DAO, known as Output, including the DAO's software itself, is open-source and licensed under MIT License.

All handling and allocation of DAO [funds](#5-funds) can be publicly verified down to [user-task](#25-tasks) level via the [auditing](#54-auditing) of transactions using the [blockchain](#61-network) in realtime.

## 1.1 Mission

The Crypto Castle's mission is to support the JMES Network by producing the most innovative, secure and reliable software for the JMES Blockchain and its users.

## 1.2 Vision

Our vision is for JMES to become the number one cryptocurrency for tokenizing real-world physical and digital art in all its forms, supported by a community of incentivized and empowered Artists creating art for users to own and enjoy within a rich ecosystem of digital and physical experiences.

## 1.3 Strategy

The DAO's strategy is defined as a set of [criteria](131-funding-criteria) that defines the types of [Bounties](#2-bounties) that [Admins](#4-admins) can fund, coupled to a [Roadmap](#132-roadmap) that defines priorities that Admins use to allocate and prioritize resources across Bounties, to ensure that resources are focused effectively in support of our [Mission](#11-mission) and [Vision](#12-vision).

## 1.3.1 Funding Criteria

[Admins](#4-admins) may fund [Bounties](#2-bounties) that meet the following criteria:

1. Funding Protocol design and development of the JMES blockchain to support and implement the DAO's Strategy, such as Validator software and Smart Contracts on JMES's Business Layer.

2. Funding end-user software, such as the Official JMES Wallet app, the Official JMES Governance App, or any kind of monetization or tokenization usecases that increases the economic usage of JMES as a currency for art.

3. Funding the development and provision of tools and resources that aid developers, users and providers within the JMES Ecosystem.

4. Funding development that improves onboarding for JMES users.

5. Funding development that improves and sustains the DAO itself.

6. Funding Infrastructure development, maintenance and provision to support and implement the DAO's Strategy as needed.

7. Funding promotion of JMES related software to developers and end-users.

8. Funding activities in other DAOs with synergistic Strategies where doing so will expedite, support or unblock resources or products upon which our Mission depends.

9. Kickstarting initiatives that help to support and retain developers who are key to the JMES project in general.

10. Kickstarting DAO forks with synergistic Strategies to increase competition and decentralization within the JMES ecosystem.

11. Funding core team incentives for the development of the blockchain up till launch.

Bounties that don't meet any of these criteria won't be funded by the DAO.

> The term Kickstarting is used in the DAO to mean the funding of Bounties that initiate projects but include a plan to hand them off to 3rd parties to fund and monetize their longer-term development, including potentially raising individual Proposals to accomplish that.

## 1.3.2 Roadmap

Our Roadmap is the list of priorities by which we allocate resources between [Bounties](#2-bounties) and is stated in the most recent [Proposal](#65-proposals).

## 1.4 Full-Transparency

To ensure that the DAO's processes and information remain fully open-source and encourage the same standard for other DAOs on the JMES Blockchain, we introduce the following criteria for an **Open-Source DAO** classification that the DAO implements:

1. All funding receipts and expenditure are tracked

2. All work systems and their data are public

3. All work preparation and pricing is public

4. All work output is public

5. All people's work and rewards are public and verifiable

6. All rules governing the DAO and decisions on how to maintain those rules are public

The only exception would be user credentials, i.e. their login passwords.

## 1.5 Users

There are several levels to classification of DAO users as follows:

- Users - anyone who accesses the DAO's website or its underlying data

- Members - any user who has signed up to create an account 

- [Contributors](#3-contributing) - Members who create output for the DAO

- [Admins](#4-admins) - Members with rights to create and manage Bounties, and earn commission from Task rewards

- [Proposal Owners (PO)](#53-proposal-owner) - an Admin who is designated to raise Proposals to the network on behalf of the DAO

 - End-Users - anyone who uses a product developed by the DAO

> Currently all Members can be found as members of our [Trello board](#63-bounty-system)

## 1.6 Network Contract

This document contains the Rules that define the terms between the DAO and the [Network](#61-network) for how any funding awarded to the DAO by the Network will be used.

When coupled with DAO's [full transparency](#14-full-transparency) policy, anyone can trustlessly audit how well the DAO is meeting the commitments of these terms in realtime, including verifying the use of all funding via the JMES blockchain itself down to a user/task level.

We refer to the transparent implementation of the terms defined in this document in return for the funding provided from JMES Network as the Network Contract.

The DAO is required to abide by the Network Contract at all times.

The authoritative source for the Rules are contained in a single document hosted on [Github](#62-dao), with updates to the Rules (enacted as merged commits to the master branch) taking effect immediately.

## 1.7 Legal

The DAO is an open-source DAO and not a legal entity and as such doesnâ€™t own any assets, including any rights to any output, nor does the DAO apply any restrictions on contributor's usage of their own Task output, apart from the requirement that all output must be licensed as open-source under a license such as MIT or Apache.

The only funding the DAO receives is in the form of JMES tokens issued directly from the JMES blockchain, which it redistributes to users who provide verifiable open-source output for predefined tasks approved by Admins, who agree to operate in accordance with the Rules defined in this document.

The DAO does not handle, hold or pay fiat currency and all rewards are issued in JMES tokens as incentives for creating some open-source output, at the sole discretion of DAO Admins, and without any agreement or action to purchase or procure any assets, intellectual property or labor.

# 2 Bounties

A Bounty in the DAO means a collection of work that can be completed by contributors for a reward, such as development or promotion of the Network or of the DAO itself.

Bounties are first proposed as Concepts by the community, and there are three [types](#22-bounty-types) of Bounty that can be funded, each containing a series of [Tasks](#22-bounty-types) that are managed by the Bounty's [Admin](#4-admins), who earn a % commission of all rewards that the Bounty generates.

  
## 2.1 Concepts

All Bounties start as a Concept [proposed](#31-proposing-concepts) to the DAO by a community member.

Concepts are proposals for some work that the DAO should fund as a Bounty, that provide enough detail about the value proposition and requirements of the work to enable Contributors to complete it.

[Admins](#4-admins) create a Bounty for each Concept they Accept that they then Own, meaning they have the rights to manage and earn commission from its delivery.

Admins can [Accept](#435-processing-task-claims) any Concept that meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria) on a first-come first-serve basis.

Once accepted, the user who created the Concept is automatically assigned as a [Stakeholder](#25-bounty-stakeholders) to the bounty and awarded a Stakeholder task for the submitted Concept.

## 2.2 Bounty Types

When a Bounty is created from a [Concept](#21-concepts) by an [Admins](#4-admins), they assign one of three types for the new Bounty that determine how work will be structured:

-  **Projects** develop products such as end-user software, tools for the community or improvements to the JMES Protocol itself.

-  **Services** provide ongoing work that involves provision of some service, such as website hosting, code maintenance, or a recurring requirement for servicing the DAO itself.

-  **Jobs** are one-off pieces of work, such as finding bugs or fixing a github issue.

> All Bounties in the DAO are represented by a Card on our [Trello board](#63-bounty-system). The Bounty's type is represented by the column the Card is in on the Board. Meta Bounties are shown with the pink label on the Card's front cover.

## 2.3 Bounty Status

Each Bounty can be set to have one of the following Statuses at any time:

-  **Active** - The Bounty is in progress and any Tasks can be created, edited or completed

-  **Inactive** - The Bounty is on-hold and no Tasks can be created, edited or completed

-  **Pending** - The Bounty has been accepted as a Concept but not yet assigned to an Admin.

## 2.4 Bounty Stakeholders

Admins may wish to solicit the views of subject area experts or other key stakeholders as part of the decision making process when defining bounty tasks. In this case, the Admin will add and assign a Stakeholder task to the bounty so their input is incentivised and the nature of interest/input recorded against the Bounty data.

[Concept](#21-concepts) creators are automatically added as Stakeholders of the Bounty that derives from the Concept.

## 2.5 Tasks

A Task is the basic unit-of-work in the DAO and represents a unit of open-source output that a user can produce for a specified reward.

All work in the DAO, and consequently any use of funds, is performed via completion of a Task by a user, or the management of that Task by an [Admin](#4-admins), within a specific Bounty.

Tasks are defined by Admins and can be completed by any user after [reserving](#33-reserving-tasks) the tasks with the Admin, or in the case of [Job](#22-bounty-types) tasks, completed without reservation.

Each Task must define some quantifiable Output (a document, commit, etc) that a user can produce to be eligible to [Claim](#26-claims) the specified reward.

There are five types of Task available:

- [Stakeholder Tasks](#251-stakeholder-tasks) - any input against the bounty not covered by other task types, including the initial creation of the Bounty's Concept

- [Specification Tasks](#252-specification-tasks) - work that provides the detail necessary to define Production Tasks

- [Design Tasks](#253-design-tasks) - work that provides plans or visual representation of requirements defined within Specification Tasks

- [Production Tasks](#254-production-tasks) - work related to Tasks required to complete Project, Service and Job bounties

- [QA Tasks](#255-qa-tasks) - work that assures the quality of Production Tasks

> Each Task Type is represented as a named Checklist on the Bountyâ€™s Trello Card.

### 2.5.1 Stakeholder Tasks

Stakeholder Tasks incentivize bounty contributions by interested parties such as subject matter experts or Product Owners. 

The [Claim](#34-claiming-tasks) for a new Concept Reward is a Stakeholder task implicitly approved as soon as an Admin [Accepts](#41-accepting-concepts) the Concept.

### 2.5.2 Specification Tasks

Specification Tasks define how [Production Tasks](#254-production-tasks) should be completed and/or [QA'd](#255-qa-tasks).

The output is usually a document such as a Functional or QA Specification, or any resource that enables output relating to achieving the Value Proposition of the Bounty to be produced and QA'd effectively.

Admins measure the quality of the Specification in terms of its fitness for purpose and adequate detail level to define the Production Tasks a [Contributor](#15-users) needs to implement it.

### 2.5.3 Design Tasks

Design Tasks provide visual representation of the product, system or project defined in [Specification Tasks](#254-production-tasks).

Usually Design Tasks output Figma, wireframes or any other file that can be used as a visual guide for productions tasks.

Design output should be functional, asthetically pleasing and should meet the needs of the intended audience.

### 2.5.4 Production Tasks

Production Tasks are the actual output of a Bounty that deliver the value proposition.

Usually Production Tasks output some code or a working product, but if the Bounty is for example a research project, the Production Tasks could output documents or analysis, or any format that satisfies the goals of the Bounty.

### 2.5.5 QA Tasks

Quality Assurance tasks validate and test that [Production Tasks](#253-production-tasks) meet their [Specification](#252-specification-tasks).

Most Production Tasks require related QA tasks. Specifications can include a QA plan to provide a clear and easy way to measure how well a Production Task meets its spec when the QA is performed.

QA Tasks must reference the relevant Specification, Design or Production Task and produce some QA report output.

> It is recommended to use the [QA Report Template](#63-bounty-system) unless the admin requests an alternative format.

## 2.6 Claims

A Claim is the process of a user signalling that they have completed a [Task](#25-tasks) and wish to receive the Task's stated reward.

Users can create Claims for Tasks they believe to be complete from the [Admin](#4-admins) who owns the Task using the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks).

Once a Task Claim is approved by an Admin, the Task Reward will be awarded to the JMES address the claimant specified in the Claim within 7 days.

## 2.7 Rewards

The DAO is a pure-coin fund meaning all rewards are awarded in JMES. It's not permitted to create bounties with non-JMES denominated rewards, although individual users can be incentivized to exchange amounts out-of-band via tasks.

Each type of [Task](#25-tasks) offered by the DAO has limits on the min/max rewards an Admin may [price](#433-pricing-tasks) as defined below.

These limits will be built into the rules once the JMES valuation has stabalised - hence the placeholders values of 'tbc' in the list below.

The Admin % is an added [commission reward](#44-admin-rewards) that an Admin earns for Approving a Claim on a Task they own, plus a [commission bonus](#441-commission-bonuses) based on the Admin's level of activity.

# 3 Contributing

Contributing to the DAO involves completing [Tasks](#25-tasks) on [Bounties](#2-bounties) to earn [Rewards](#27-rewards).

A reward can also be earned by proposing a Concept for new Bounties that get accepted by an [Admin](#4-admins).

All work produced at the DAO must be open-sourced under MIT license before any rewards can be paid, to satisfy the DAO's [full-transparency](#14-full-transparency) requirements.

## 3.1 Proposing Concepts

Anyone can create a [Concept](#21-concepts) by submitting a [New Concept](#62-dao).

Any [Admin](#4-admins) can [Accept](#435-processing-task-claims) a Concept that meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria), meaning they create a new [Bounty](#2-bounties) for it that they become the owner of, or they assign it to the Pending Bounty list for another Admin to own.

The [Concept Reward](#271-price-list) is paid to the JMES address listed in the Concept if and when it is accepted by any of the Admins.

>- To propose a Concept, add a comment on the [New Concept Card](#62-dao) on Trello.

>- To chat with Admins about a Concept or its acceptance, join the [Discord](#62-dao).

## 3.2 Completing Job Tasks

Job Tasks on Bounties are open to be claimed by anyone without needing to reserve the task.

To claim a reward on a Job task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks)

## 3.3 Reserving Tasks

Any tasks other than Jobs can be reserved. This means that you can agree with the Task's Admin to have exclusive rights to claim the Task until the due date.

To reserve a task, leave a comment for the Admin of the Bounty that the Task is a part of, so that they can assign the task to you, and/or discuss the Task details and negotiate the reward.

Once you have completed the Task, use the [Claims process](#34-claiming-tasks) to claim the reward.

If a claim isn't made by the due date, the Admin can extend the date, or has the option to cancel the reservation.

> To be able to Reserve a Task please join as a Member of our Trello Board by leaving a comment on our [Member Signup Card](#63-bounty-system).

## 3.4 Claiming Tasks

Once you have completed the work for a Task you can make a [Claim](#26-claims) for the reward on the Task, by providing the following information:

1. Link to the source for the tasks output (specific PR or commit for Github code)

2. Link to any deploy links relevant to the output (e.g. a URL for a website)

3. Specify a valid JMES address to receive the reward, or set to [NULL](#341-null-claims) to decline the reward.

Once your Claim has been created it will [processed](#435-processing-task-claims) by an admin.

> To create a Claim on Trello, leave a comment on the Bounty's [Trello Card](TODO) specifying the number and type of the Task you are claiming, along with the source links and your JMES address.

### 3.4.1 Null Claims

In some cases, users wish to decline rewards for some reason.

This is strongly discouraged as incentives are how the DAO maintains a high level of creativity, productivity, and quality of output, and Claims themselves are how we track and account for work completion in the Bounty System.

However, to support the requirement, we introduced the option to create a Null Claim.

Therefore users who wish to decline rewards still need to make a Claim to signify and enable tracking of a Task's completion, but they can set the claim's JMES address to 'NULL' to signify that the actual reward is declined and therefore won't be awarded.

> To create a Null Claim in Trello, simply enter the term 'NULL' in place of a JMES address on the relevant [Claim comment](#42-claiming-tasks).

# 4 Admins

Admins are a second-tier of users in the DAO who are incentivized to manage Bounties by earning a [commission](#44-admin-rewards) on all Tasks completed within the Bounty.

As all work (and spending) is structured as a Bounty within the DAO, and Bounties can relate to working on the DAO itself and be both managed and produced by Admins, they represent a decentralized layer of users who manage every aspect of the DAO.

Admins are peers, each with control of a share of the DAO's funds that they can use to create and manage bounties that incentivize Contributors to produce output for the DAO.

Admins can simultaneously act as Contributors, by completing Tasks set by other Admins, but they cannot price, reserve or approve Tasks for themselves.

Admins have additional rights to appoint other Admins and to maintain the Rules defined in this document, which define all aspects of how the DAO should operate, which they are each responsible for implementing correctly.

> On Trello, the board is configured to only allow Admins to create and edit cards, including defining and assigning tasks to Board members. Any user can comment on cards to interact with Admins about the bounties they're managing.

## 4.1 Accepting Concepts

Bounties are created via the Acceptance of a user-submitted [Concept](#31-concepts) by an Admin.

- A Bounty is only created from a Concept approval, and all Bounties must refer back to a single Concept.

- Any Admin can Accept a new Concept but must first validate that it meets our [Concept Acceptance Criteria](#411-concept-acceptance-criteria)

- Admins do not need permission from or consensus between other Admins to accept a Concept.

- Admins can submit new Concepts themselves, but need another Admin to Accept them.

- Once a Concept is Accepted, an implicit Claim for the Concept Task reward is considered to be approved automatically

>  - In Trello, Admins formally Accept a Concept by [creating a new Bounty](#421-creating-bounties) for the Concept and linking it in a reply to the user's comment on the [New Concept Card](#62-dao) card.

>  - The Admin should also add an entry to the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts), using the user's details and JMES address from the Concept they submitted.

### 4.1.1 Concept Acceptance Criteria

Admins must judge that Concepts they wish to Accept meet all of the following criteria:

1. Provide a clear Value Proposition that can return value to JMES that's inline with our [Strategy](#13-strategy) and [Vision](#12-vision).

2. Provide enough detail on requirements to enable a Bounty to achieve the stated goals.

3. Be technically feasible using the current JMES Protocol or some unreleased but known iteration of it.

4. Be unique within the existing set of Concepts & Bounties already added to the DAO, i.e. not a duplicate or very similar scope to an existing active Bounty.

5. Be achievable in terms of costs compared to the DAO's current funding levels.

6. The Description text reflects the Value Proposition of the related Concept.

## 4.2 Bounty Management

> In Trello, Bounty ownership is designated by the Admin putting their Trello username into the Admin field on the card and adding themselves as a Member of the card on the top left below the card title. When two Admins are assigned to the card, the secondary Admin is designated by putting their Trello username into the Secondary Admin field on the card.

### 4.2.2 Bounty Ownership

The Admin who created a Bounty is given the rights as the Owner of that Bounty, also known as the Primary Admin of the Bounty.

The Bounty Owner has exclusive rights to edit the Bounty's fields, define Tasks and process resulting Claims, and change the Bounty's [Status](#23-bounty-status).

The Bounty Owner may transfer ownership to another Admin at any time or assign the Bounty to the Pending Bounty column for any Admin to claim.

> In Trello, Ownership is determined by the Admin who is a Member of the Card and who's username is specified in the Admin field.

### 4.2.3 Secondary Admins

The Bounty Owner can optionally appoint a Secondary Admin (Secondary) to the Bounty, enabling a maximum of two Admins to manage a bounty at one time.

Secondaries cannot edit the Bounty's details but can create Tasks that they [own](#432-task-ownership) within the Bounty independently from the Bounty Owner's Tasks, and process Claims on those and receive their Admin Reward.

This enables multiple Admins to manage a single Bounty and complete Tasks provided that those Tasks are owned by another Admin on the Bounty.

The Bounty's Owner Admin can transfer the Secondary slot to a different Admin at any time, or remove the Secondary altogether without their agreement, however, the removed Secondary will still retain control of any Tasks they owned on the Bounty.

Secondaries can leave a Bounty or transfer the secondary position to another Admin who agrees at any time.

> In Trello, Bounty Owners can appoint Secondaries on a Card by entering their name in the Secondary Admin field and assigning them as a Member of the Card.

### 4.2.4 Forking Bounties

Apart from creating a new Bounty from a Concept, Admins have another option to fork a Bounty, by creating a new Bounty that shares the original Concept but is providing some significant modification, revision or alternative implementation to the Bounty that is being forked.

> In Trello, a fork can be created from a Bounty's Card by just making a new Card and linking the Concept that both Card's share in the Concept Doc custom field of the card.

## 4.3 Task Management

### 4.3.1 Creating Tasks

Admins can create [Tasks](#25-tasks) on any Bounty that they're the current Owner or Secondary Admin of.

When creating a Task, the Admin sets the Description, which must provide enough information to allow a Contributor to complete the work, either in the description itself or by linking a Specification.

The due-date is the date whereby if a [Claim](#26-claims) is not made for the Task, the Admin has the option to cancel the task or cancel any reservation at the Admin's discretion.

> When defining a Task in Trello, the Admin will chose the correct Checklist for the task type, and specify the following information:
>1. A Task number, which is the sequential number of the Task in the relevant Checklist
>2. A Description, summarising the broad requirements by a short definition is needed, and a link to a Specification to provide further detail if needed.
>3. An amount of JMES for the Reward. This can be [negotiated](#433-pricing-tasks) between the Admin and prospective users
>4. The name of the Admin who created the Task (i.e. the [Task Owner](#432-task-ownership))
>5. When reserving a Task for a user, specify the due-date and assign the Trello user as the member on the Task
>
> This information should be entered into the Task description in the following format:
>
>```[taskNumber](AdminUsername)[taskDescription](AdminUsername)([amount] JMES)```

### 4.3.2 Task Ownership

When either the Primary or Secondary Admin defines a [Task](#25-tasks) they become the Owner of that Task.

A Task owner has exclusive rights to:

- Edit or complete the Task

- Process Claims on those Tasks and therefore receive the Admin reward on any awarded Claims.

- Transfer Ownership of the Task to another Admin

- Optionally, the Admin can set Task ownership to 'Open' by omitting their name from the task description, meaning the other Admin on the bounty is free to process the Claim and receive the commission reward

If an Admin leaves a Bounty, for example via Owner transfer or removal of a secondary, the leaving Admin retains ownership of their own Tasks after they left, until they are completed or they decide to transfer their ownership to another Admin.

If a Task has an unprocessed Claim for more than 5 days with no response to the user from the Admin, the other Admin on the Bounty can take ownership of the Task to process the Claim and receive the commission reward.

> On Trello, Admin ownership is designated by the name of the Admin user in the Task description.
> Secondly, any Task without an Admin username in the description is considered to be 'open', meaning the other Admin on the card can process it and receive the reward.

### 4.3.3 Pricing Tasks

Pricing Tasks in the DAO takes a different and more flexible approach to traditional methods of sourcing as it factors in externalities such as priority, time constraints, skills availability (or overheads due to sourcing additional resources) and productivity incentives, whilst factoring out notions that ignore these factors such as fixed hourly-rates, market-rates or salary-based arrangements that won't necessarily achieve our goals at the speed we want or with the level of productivity we want to achieve for the value we want to deliver.

For example, if Tasks are urgent or highly specialized and resources are not available, or Tasks have existed for a long time without uptake, higher rewards can be set to achieve uptake on the Tasks, including the option to offer rewards for promoting those Tasks and/or placing the necessary resources, which can result in reward levels above traditional "market rates" to deliver the output we want in the time needed.

On the other hand, low priority tasks with multiple resources already on-boarded and available who could under-bid each other and without time-constraints can often provide output well below "market rates".

In other words, Tasks should be priced via a process to discover what is the minimum reward level needed to incentivize a Contributor to deliver something and deciding whether externalities such as needing to find & onboard the necessary resources or meet a certain deadline need to be factored in based on the Bounty's priority.

Fiat prices should be taken into consideration when a Task is created, but Tasks shouldn't be repriced if the fiat value changes unless not doing so would prevent completion of the Task.

### 4.3.4 Reserving Tasks

Except for [Job](#22-bounty-types) Bounty types, Admins must reserve Tasks to a specific user for the Task to be considered Active.

Admins can arrange reservations and negotiate the Task's terms with the user within the comments or via private communication, but once the Task is reserved to the user, the terms are considered agreed and are public information.

> On Trello, Tasks are represented by Checklists on the Bounty's Card, and are reserved by setting the Member setting to the user who reserved the Task and setting a date in the Due Date field.

### 4.3.5 Processing Task Claims

When a user completes a Task, they create a [Claim](#26-claims) that the [Task Owner](#432-task-ownership) Admin needs to process to decide if the Claim can be Approved, if QA is needed, or if there are issues that need to be resolved.

Approved Claims on Tasks go into the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts) from which the reward will be sent to the claimant.

If a Contributor wants to dispute a Claim decision, they can ask for a second opinion, in which case the other Admin on the Bounty, or any other Admin if the Bounty only has one Admin, can provide a second assessment.

Ultimately, decisions on whether some output meets the requirements specified in the Task definition are the sole discretion of the Admin who owns the Task.

> In Trello, Admins can Approve a Claim by ticking the Task's Checkbox and leaving a comment on the Bounty card as follows:
>

### 4.3.6 Retention of Task Output

Note that Admins must ensure that the output from Tasks that are approved is retained by the DAO, for example in a Google Sweet, Github org or any other type of data repository owned by the DAO itself.

This is because if contributors have stored the output of their tasks on their own GDocs, Github accounts etc, over time that output can get lost.

So its key that the DAO keeps at least a copy of all output produced, but ideally contributors work directly on DAO owned data repositories and not their own, so that all output is under the control of the DAO from inception, also so that in edge cases where there are disputes, the DAO isn't left without any of the work it might have partially rewarded.

## 4.4 Admin Rewards

Admins are incentivized via a baseline reward as a % commission on all Claims that they award on Bounty Tasks that they own, using the rates defined in the [Price List](#27-rewards), plus additional [commision bonuses](#441-commission-bonuses) for the most active Admins.

Admins can earn additional rewards by completing Bounty Tasks themselves, provided they are defined and approved by another Admin that is Primary or Secondary Admin on the Bounty, in other words, Admin's can't set and price their own work, but they can set and manage work for each other if needed.

Admin rewards for commission on tasks don't require formal claims, they are issued automatically to a Bounty Admin when the associated Tasks are awarded via the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts).

Note that Admins can also opt to decline rewards by creating a [Null Claim](#341-null-claims) on their commision within a Task Claim.

> To set a Null Claim on their Commission Reward, an Admin should enter their JMES address as 'NULL' in the Claim in the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts)

### 4.4.1 Commission Bonuses

Each individual Admin's commission is variable based on the number of [Task Claims](#26-claims) they Approved in the previous 30 days (including "today"). The commissions that Admins can earn are tiered as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><strong># of Claims Approved</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Commission Rate</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 - 14</td>
        <td>10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>15 - 29</td>
        <td>12%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>30 +</td>
        <td>15%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Each Commission Bonus is based on the Tier that the Adminâ€™s previous 30 days contributions fall into. The "next" tier of commission is effective immediately once an Admin crosses the threshold, and is effective for all claims as long as the Admin stays within the Tier.

For example:

- Admin Alice has processed 10 claims in the past 30 days (including today). If Alice processes 5 additional claims today, Alice will be eligible for a 12% commission on the 5th claim (and any additional claims).

- Admin Bob has processed 34 claims in the past 30 days, but 7 of those were processed exactly 30 days ago. If Bob processes claims today, each of those will earn 15%. If Bob does not process at least 2 claims today, his commission rate will be 12% for claims processed tomorrow until his 30 day count is 30 or more again, at which point Bob will return to a 15% commission.

- Admin Carol has processed 9 claims in the past 30 days. Today Carol processes 21 claims. For the first 5 claims Carol processes today the commission is 10%. For the next 15 (claims 15 - 29) the commissions is 12%. The final claim Carol processes has a 15% commission.

## 4.5 Governance

Admins are responsible for Governance of the DAO which is implemented via appointing or removing Admins, or updating these Rules.

An Admin Quorum is required in both cases, which means that > 50% of voting Admins agree to Admin appointments / removals or changes to the Rules etc. Admins reserve the option to recuse themselves from voting by not registering a vote (within an agreed voting period) or selecting/commenting â€˜Recuseâ€™ against the vote itself.

# 5 Funds

## 5.1 Proposals

The DAO is funded from a series of [Proposals](#65-proposals) submitted to the [JMES Network](#61-network) on a quarterly basis, with all spending of those funds commissioned and tracked via Tasks owned by Admins within the Bounty System itself and settled via transactions on the JMES blockchain that anyone can verify.

The amount requested might vary to target the general scale and buffer that Admins and the [PO](#53-proposal-owner) feel the DAO should aim to spend, but not to deliver specific projects or milestones as there is no centralized planning to do so in the DAO.

When certain projects arise that do require specific additional funding, individual proposals should be raised detailing the value proposition and estimated costs of those projects individually.

## 5.2 Budgets

All funds will be received to the published [DAO Wallet](#64-accounts) address(s) and will be pooled across proposals as a single rolling-budget available to Admins to allocate to Bounties.

The funds the PO requests from the JMES Network are purely to increase the DAO Wallet and increase the overall budget available to Admins to spend.

DAO is a pure-JMES fund meaning that rewards are denominated only in JMES. Therefore any fluctuations in the fiat price of JMES will only reflect the pricing of new [Tasks](#25-tasks) by Admins and prior agreements made in JMES are not necessarily renegotiated or adjusted.

## 5.3 Proposal Owners

The Proposal Owners (POs) are users who control the multi-sig wallet of the DAO Identity, that raises Governance Proposals to the network for, receives funding against those proposals into the DAO wallet, and are responsible for oversight.

Each Proposal Owner can optionally be an [Admin](#4-admins) in the system but it's not required.

Proposal Owners are DAO Members, meaning technically cosigners of the DAO Identity's multi-sig wallet.  The DAO must be configured with an equal share of voting, and a majority threshold.

### 5.3.1 Proposal Owners Duties

The POs agree to use funds solely for the purposes of awarding [Task Claims](#26-claims) that were approved by Admins and are inline with the Rules in this document.

Before the fully decentralized implementation (described below) is in place and to ensure that all users are adhering to these Rules and operations of the Bounty System are as efficient as possible, the POs are currently granted some additional intervention rights equivalent to 'super-powers' that maybe used as exceptions as follows.

Note that any of these actions requires a DAO Proposal to pass within the Proposal Owners member group.

- Appoint or transfer Primary or Secondary Admin positions on a Bounty

- Pause/Unpause a Bounty or some of the Tasks

- Appoint or remove Admins from the DAO

- Create Tasks on bounties when Primary/Secondary aren't available

- Mediate updates to these Rules

- Any other actions to enforce adherence to these rules

If the Proposal Owners needs to exercise any of these rights, it is an exceptional circumstance, so they must publish the decision and the vote results from the relevant DAO Proposal (e.g. on Trello or Github depending on the action) detailing the action and explaining the reasons as to why an action was taken.

### 5.3.2 Proposal Owner Elections

Proposal Owners i.e. the DAO Members are initially defined when the DAO is instantiated.  From that point, the membership of their group is tied to their own internal decision making, secondly tied to contributors (including Admins) based on their Output, so that everybody creating value in the DAO has some level of vote in the internal governance. This is to ensure that the Proposal Owner group is subject itself to governance and measure of its output (its ability to govern and raise proposals) and not its own centralized group that can end up serving its own interest and not that of the Castle or the wider Network.

An election can be called to add or remove a single member once per month calendar month, by any Admin or PO, and is tallied based on passing a 70% threshold across the POs and all the non-PO contributors who produced output in the last 3 months, with the POs accounting for 50% of that quorum.

This means that:

 - Anyone who created output in the last 3 months can have a vote in proportion to the nominal amount of rewards for their output compared to the total rewards spent in that period, which accounts for 50% of the vote.
 - The POs themselves can vote accounting for the other 50%.
 - Votes are tallied and a >=70% majority is required to either add or remove the PO from the set.

For example, lets say there are 2 POs, Alice and Bob, and 2 non-PO contributors Carol and Dave with 50% each of the Output rewards in the last 3 months, and an election is called to add a PO member called Eve.

If Alice and Bob both vote NO, < 50% quorum is reached and Eve is not elected.  But if they vote YES, and Carol or Dave vote YES, then Eve is elected.  

In other words, 3 of the 4 users need to vote YES to reach the threshold to elect Eve, and only 2 of the users need to vote NO to block Eve's election.

### 5.3.2 Decentralization Roadmap

The Proposal Owners are a temporary measure until the DAO can be fully decentralized in future, which will take the form of the CW4_group contract being replaced with code that automates awarded Task claim payments from the wallet and implements these Rules as fully smart-code.  At that time, the Proposal Owners can still perform an oversight but will lose the ability (or the need) to spend the DAO's funds manually.  Voting on their set will automatically be extended to be tied to votes that correlate to actual Output via the contracts.  

It should also be noted that budgetting needs to be implemented, both in terms of internal planning of what Admins can spend and in which areas of the DAO, and secondly, allowing the Network to claw-back unspent funds that have built up , to avoid situations where the Proposal Owners build up large "war chests" that can immunise them against Network control, i.e. they can lose proposals and not be incentivized so strongly to implement Network decisions because they have large buffers of funds to fall back on.  Note that unless Admins are making fake tasks, it wouldn't be possible for POs to move funds from the wallet in the first place to avoid claw-backs, because they don't have the ability to spend funds in that role in the DAO contract.

> The Proposal Owners roles should be incentivized by a [Service Bounty](#22-bounty-types) defined within the DAO's Bounty System itself for the overheads of Proposal raising, fund management and transacting, added risk / responsiblity and for the added strategic oversight needed to execute the intervention-based "super powers" before a full code implementation is realized.

## 5.4 Auditing

As an [Open-source DAO](#14-full-transparency), anyone can perform a full public audit of the DAO at any time, to check that all work is being conducted as per these Rules, and verify the rewards issued to individual DAO users for that work via the JMES blockchain.

Below we provide guidelines on how to audit the DAO from a financial, operational and output perspective, but people can devise their own audit strategies as they wish.

### 5.4.1 Auditing Accounts

Every JMES of funding spent by the DAO must be accounted for via a [Task Claim](#26-claims) approved by an [Admin](#4-admins) with an associated transaction on the JMES blockchain.

Therefore we can verify that the total funds spent listed on the [JMES Blockchain](#61-network) tally to total task claims awarded in the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts) to ensure that funds aren't being spent from the wallet arbitrarily by validating that:

- Total funds spent via the Blockchain is equal to the total JMES sent minus the total JMES received from the [DAO Wallet](#64-accounts).

- Total funds spent on awarded Task Claims is equal to the total JMES spent in columns H (Reward) and N (Admin reward) in the [Payments Sheet](#64-accounts).

Note that each Task lists the transaction id, which can also be parsed individually to verify the total amount.

### 5.4.2 Auditing Work

All work must be conducted inline with the Rules in this document and in the public domain. Therefore anyone can audit how well the work being conducted in the DAO is adhering to these rules at any time.

As a guideline, the following aspects of work are key areas to ensure the Rules are being implemented effectively.

- Admins are pricing work effectively by factoring value gained, available contributors and urgency

- Admins are conforming to and interpreting the rules effectively

- Concepts being approved are inline with the [Strategy](#13-strategy)

- Quality of output is sufficient for rewards

- Task deadlines and due dates are being managed effectively
